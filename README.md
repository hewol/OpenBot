# OpenBot
- **OpenBot is an Open Source Discord Bot made by Hewol**

## Deploy it
1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your bot's token in the `.env` file. Replace `<token>` with your bot's token.
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your server/machine.
3. Run the bot with the command `node main.js`.
4. That's it! The bot should be working! To test it, run a slash command, and if you get a response, it is working!

<i>It's that easy.</i>

## Normal Route
Just to make your life a bit easier, you can add the bot and use it normally: [Bot Invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1141365284968607758&permissions=8&scope=bot)

### Under Development Currently
For now the bot we deployed needs `Administrator` permissions, but later we will narrow the perms required after all making and testing is done.
