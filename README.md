# Openbot
- **OpenBot is an Open Source Discord Bot made by Hewol**

## Manual deployment
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your bot's token in the `.env` file. Replace `<token>` with your bot's token.
2. Install [Python](https://python.org) on your server or machine.
3. Run the bot with the command `python3 -OO main.py` or `python -OO main.py`
4. That's it! The bot should be working. To test it, run any of the slash commands.

<i><sup><sub>It's that easy.</sub></sup></i>

## Pre-deployed bot
Just to make your life a bit easier, you can [add the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1141365284968607758&permissions=8&scope=bot) to use it normally.

### Under development
For now the bot needs `Administrator` permissions, but later we will narrow the permissions down after everything is done.
