# Openbot
- **OpenBot is an Open Source Discord Bot made by Hewol**

## Deploy it
1. Add your bot's token to the .env file (Replace `<token>` with your bot's token)
2. Install NodeJS on your server or machine or whatever it is (https://nodejs.org/)
3. Run the bot with the command `node main.js`
4. That's it! The bot should be running!

yes it's that simple

## Normal Route
Just to make your life a bit eaiser, you can add the bot and use it normally...
