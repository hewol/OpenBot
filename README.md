# Openbot
- **OpenBot is an Open Source Discord Bot made by Hewol**

## Deploy it
1. Rename the .env.example file to .env and add your bot's token and id in the .env file. Replace `<token>` with your bot's token
3. Install Python on your server or machine: https://python.org
4. Run the bot with the command `python3 main.py`
5. That's it! The bot should be working! To test it run any of the slash commands.

<sup><sub>It's that easy.</sub></sup>

## Normal Route
Just to make your life a bit easier, you can add the bot and use it normally...

### Under Developement Currently
For now the bot we deployed needs `Administrator` but later we will narrow the perms list down after all making and testing is done.
